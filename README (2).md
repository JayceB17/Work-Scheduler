Day scheduler

The user can input their tasks or notes into each hour block of the day, and the application saves the input data to local storage so that the information persists even if the user closes or refreshes the page.

The application is structured using a simple HTML layout that includes a header, a container for the hour blocks, and a footer that contains the date and time. The CSS file provides the styling for the application, while the JavaScript code handles the functionality of the app, including updating the time, saving user input to local storage, and applying the appropriate styling to each hour block.
